# How I built my project.

Here are the steps:
1. Initialize a project using the TypeScript Vanilla template: `pnpm create vite`
2. Create my library in the `lib` folder.
3. In the `src` folder, build a demo.
4. Create GitHub Actions workflows in the `.github/workflows` folder for GitHub Pages deploy and automatic NPM package deployment.
